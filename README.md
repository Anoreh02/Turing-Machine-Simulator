# Turing-Machine-Simulator
A visual and interactive JavaScript-based Turing Machine Simulator designed for educational purposes.

Key Features:
    Interactive Tape Interface: Visually observe the machine's tape and the head's movements.
    Custom Transitions: Define custom transition rules, including read, write, move (L/R), and next state.
    Flexible Initialization: Input your own tape data and machine states for dynamic configurations.
    Step-by-Step Execution: Execute transitions step by step or run the machine automatically.
    Halting States: Define custom accept and reject states.
    Reset and Reinitialize: Easily reset the machine and start a new simulation.

Project Structure:
    HTML: User interface for displaying the tape, input fields, and control buttons.
    CSS: Responsive design with a dark-themed aesthetic for an engaging user experience.
    JavaScript: Core logic for simulating the Turing machine, managing transitions, and updating the tape.
    
Usage:
    Enter a tape input (e.g., 0101) in the provided field.
    Define transition rules using the state, read symbol, write symbol, move direction (L/R), and next state.
    Set optional accept and reject states.
    Initialize the tape and start the machine to simulate its behavior.

Installation:
    Clone the repository, then open index.html in a modern web browser to get started. No additional dependencies are required.
