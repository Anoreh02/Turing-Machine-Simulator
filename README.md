# Turing-Machine-Simulator
An interactive and visually engaging JavaScript-based Turing Machine Simulator designed for educational purposes. This tool allows users to explore the fundamentals of Turing machines through a hands-on approach.

## üöÄ Key Features

    Interactive Tape Interface
    Visually observe the machine's tape and the head's movements in real-time.

    Custom Transitions
    Define transition rules, including:

        Read symbol
        Write symbol
        Move direction (L/R)
        Next state

    Flexible Initialization
    Input custom tape data and machine states for dynamic configurations.

    Step-by-Step Execution
    Execute transitions manually or run the machine automatically for a seamless experience.

    Halting States
    Customize accept and reject states for your simulation.

    Reset and Reinitialize
    Easily reset the machine and start a new simulation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

    HTML
    User interface for displaying the tape, input fields, and control buttons.

    CSS
    Responsive design with a dark-themed aesthetic for an engaging user experience.

    JavaScript
    Core logic for simulating the Turing machine, managing transitions, and updating the tape.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

    1. Enter a tape input (e.g., 0101) in the provided field.
    2. Define transition rules using the:
        state
        read symbol 
        write symbol
        move direction (L/R)
        and next state.
    3. Set custom accept and reject states.
    4. Initialize the tape and start the machine to simulate its behavior.
